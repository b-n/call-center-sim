# Call center javascript sim

Just a small javascript simulator for a call center. Current routing assumes all 
agents are able to answer all calls

## running

`yarn run dev`

## configuration

There are a bunch of settings across different files. These will eventually all 
be broken down into one global settings file

## TODO

- Skills based routin
- Handling multi types of activities (chats, emails, etc)
- Configuration settings
- Maybe a UI? Maybe run in browser?
